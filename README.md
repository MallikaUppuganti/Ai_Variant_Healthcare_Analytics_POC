# 🏥 HealthCare Analytics
### Company: Ai Variant | Tools: Power BI, Excel, MySQL, Tableau | Domain: Healthcare & Life Sciences

## 📌 Project Summary
This project is a Proof of Concept developed for a leading client in the Healthcare domain. The goal was to enable healthcare leaders to make data-informed decisions by transforming raw clinical data into an accessible, visually compelling format. 

As a Data Analyst, I led the end-to-end workflow, from raw data cleaning and transformation to designing a dynamic dashboards that empowers stakeholders with instant decision-making capability.

The dashboards equip healthcare stakeholders with data-driven decision-making based on real-world clinical data. Built using Power BI and Excel, the dashboards provide real-time insights into patient demographics, diagnoses, doctor performance, lab results and follow-up rates. MySQL was used for querying and structuring backend data, while Tableau was used for cross-platform validation and benchmarking (in collaboration with a teammate).


## 🎯 Business Objectives
* Track total patients, doctors, visits and lab results to monitor institutional scale

* Analyze the top 5 diagnosed conditions and medical specialties

* Understand follow-up rates and test result patterns
  
* Evaluate treatment cost distribution to identify cost-saving opportunities

* Provide filterable views by year and city for better strategic planning
